                    <div class='webContent'>
                        <p class='contentText'>Well... I officially have two weeks of the Web Development bootcamp in the
                            books, and I gotta say, I I'm pumped. The class is still in review mode, and I've spent a
                            lot of time working on my Text Adventure (NPM package coming soon!) while we have gone over
                            material in class. I've been able to work on my skills as a teacher though, as I've spent a
                            good deal of time helping the class out. It even looks like I'm going to get to TA the
                            upcoming part time class, which I'm really excited about.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class='contentText'>Now when I said I spent most of my week working on my text adventure,
                            that might have been a slight exaggeration... I spent the entire week working on it,
                            basically whenever I could. During the part time course, we got assigned this project called
                            Zorkington, where we had to make a small text based adventure (like Zork) based in
                            Burlington. I asked if I could go off on my own route, and make a game of my own design.
                            Thankfully, that was totally within fine with my professor (Bob... he's the man), and I
                            began excitedly plugging away at what would soon become a small obsession. After some light
                            storyboarding, map drawing, and writing... Robot Apocalypse was born. The game I turned in
                            for that project was ok, but nowhere near what I had envisioned. After the part time class
                            ended, I spent quite a bit of time tinkering with the game, and using it as an excuse to
                            learn new things.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class='contentText'>Fast forward to about a week and a half ago when I find out that I can
                            continue working on that project, and turn it in for the same project in the Full Time boot
                            camp I'm currently enrolled in. I'm beyond excited to keep working on the game, and dive
                            even deeper into javascript libraries I hadn't worked with before. I find new bugs, learn
                            more about node.js in order to figure them out, find new bugs again, learn more again... the
                            cycle has been incredible. I never thought running full boar into a wall I knew was coming
                            could be so much fun, but that's what coding is all about. Every couple steps forward, there
                            is a step back (sometimes more). I've learned to instead of letting that get me down, to
                            embrace it. It's part of the learning experience, and it's a part that will never go away.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class='contentText'>I think I'll end this one here, since it feels like I've hit a life
                            lesson of sorts. I've had a hard time in the past with self worth, and feeling like a
                            failure. Coding has really helped me understand that shortcomings and pitfalls are just part
                            of the journey.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class='contentText'>Until next week, happy coding!</p>

                    <div class='webContent'>
                        <p class='contentText'>Hello world! I know it's a bit cliche' to say that, but it's where we all
                            started in our programming journey right? Anyway, since this is the first post in this blog,
                            I figured some introductions would be in order. Since this is all rhetorical, I'll start
                            with myself.... Hi! My name is Josh, and I'm an aspiring web-devoloper. I've been in the
                            restaurant gig for pretty much the entirety of my adult life, and am finally pursuing my
                            passions in the tech world. I'm the father of two amazing children, and am married to an
                            incredible woman that continues to push me towards bettering myself and the world around me.
                            I decided to start writing this blog as a way to sort of catalogue my journey in the world
                            of programming and web development.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class='contentText'>I am currently in my first week of class in a web development bootcamp at
                            Burlington Code Academy, have taken the part time javascript course here at BCC, and have
                            taken some online courses. As a father with two small children, taking a 40 hour a week
                            course while still working a couple nights a week is already proving to be a challenge, but
                            one that I welcome and am ready to overcome. Being a restaurant manager for many years has
                            gotten me ready for any grind, and the payout this time around is more than worth it.
                            Anyway, I'll keep this post brief, but as I progress through the course, I plan on posting
                            each week with how things are progressing. There will probably be the oddball comic or
                            pictures of the kiddos (like any parent, I'll claim that my kids are adorable...but trust me
                            they are), and most likely snippets of code and projects as time passes. So if you are into
                            coding, cute kids, goofy robot comics, want to see what projects I'm working on, or feel
                            like learning more about me, feel free to stop by each week and check it out!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class='contentText'>Thanks for checking out my work! Until next week, happy coding!</p>
