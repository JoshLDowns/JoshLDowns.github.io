                        <p class='contentText'>Week four of the bootcamp is in the books, and I am feeling pretty
                            excited about the future. There are plenty more hurdles on my journey, but each of them
                            bring new challenges and new opportunites. There were two big focuses this past week, CSS
                            and beginning my job search. As much as CSS can be a pain, the latter was definitely the
                            most
                            challenging part of my week. Writing a brand new resume and cover letter is a pretty
                            daunting task, especially when you are jumping into a new field. Thankfully, Burlington Code
                            Academy has pulled out all of the stops, and provided us with a pretty awesome career
                            workshop on top of the great education we've been getting.</p>
                        </br>
                        <p class='contentText'>I have to say, looking for work in the tech field is way more
                            intimidating than what I'm used to as a restaurant guy. There is just so much more that goes
                            into it. When I would apply for a restaurant gig, it was mostly based on word of mouth, a
                            casual interview over a beer, and my resume would almost never come into play. But in this
                            field, let me tell you, that isn't at all the case. I've focused on not only my resume and
                            cover letter, but my LinkedIn profile, my gitHub account, this portfolio website, and a
                            multitude of networking endeavors. At first this was all foreign and a bit unnerving, but
                            the more time I've spent working on it, the more accomplished and validated I feel. It truly
                            feels like the work I'm putting in matters, and that it will help me move forward with my
                            goals.</p>
                        </br>
                        <p class='contentText'>I don't want this post to be entirely about my job search, as it's still
                            in it's infancy, but I will say that I have a couple initial places I will be applying to
                            right away. With just eight weeks left in the course, and most interview processes taking
                            potentially months, I want to get the ball rolling right away. With that all being said,
                            there is one little code snippet I wanted to share that I am pretty happy with this week.
                        </p>

                        <p class='contentText'>If you have been to my site before, you might have noticed the little
                            robot that lives at the bottom left hand side of all of these pages. As the pages got
                            longer, I wanted him to pop his goofy head in as you scrolled past the navigation bar, but
                            this was something I'd never done before. After a little research, and some tinkering, I
                            came up with this:</p>
                        <div class='blogPickWrapper'>
                            <img class='blog-pic' src='./resources/images/scrollSnip.png'

                        </div>
                        </br>
                        <p class='contentText'>I know it doesn't look like much, and it definitely still has some things
                            I could improve on, but it works! The biggest thing I want to play with is removing the
                            event listener on the triggers so that the function isn't being called over and over again.
                            It's not repainting each time it does that, so there really isn't much of an impact but I
                            think learning how to do that for more intricate implications will be necessary. Either way,
                            little improvements on the site will keep coming as I learn more, and I'm excited to really
                            push the limits of what I can do with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

                    <div class='webContent'>
                        <p class='contentText'>Tic Tac Toe.... I never thought such a simple game would be the bane of
                            my existence, but let me tell you, I felt like I was playing Celeste (if you haven't played
                            this game yet... you should) B-Sides coding the AI
                            to play this simple game over the weekend. Thankfully, Celeste B-Sides (albeit incredibly
                            difficult) are super fun! Before diving into the specifics, I have to admit.... the
                            difficulty here was mostly brought on by myself. I did my usual thing of diving really deep
                            and
                            overthinking the problem, and it led me down some pretty deep rabbit holes. The deepest of
                            those rabbit holes was MiniMax.</p>
                        </br>
                        <p class='contentText'>If you don't know what MiniMax is, it's basically an algorithm that can
                            be used to figure out the best possible move in deterministic games. It does this by looking
                            some amount of moves ahead in a game, and assigning scores to each move based on the outcome
                            of that move. During this determination, the player making the move is trying to maximize
                            their best results (positive scores for positive outcomes), while minimizing the opponents
                            best results (negative scores for negative outcomes) ...hence MiniMax. Sounds totally simple
                            right? I thought so too, but then I dove in.</p>
                        </br>
                        <p class='contentText'>I should probably say that I went this route because I had already done
                            the Tic Tac Toe project in the part time Javascript class I took a few months ago. I had
                            built an AI that played the game perfectly that time around, but the first few turns of the
                            game were very much hard coded in. To challenge myself (because pain is progress! ... that
                            isn't meant to sound as rough as it does ...) this time around, I wanted to write a script
                            that figured out those first couple moves, and every other move on it's own.
                        </p>
                        </br>
                        <p class='contentText'>So lets dive into the coding process. My first attempt, obviously
                            following the
                            most proper order of trying things, was the deepest dive. I wrote a script that first built
                            every single possible board state branching off from every possible move on the board. Even
                            for a game like Tic Tac Toe, that can be a lot of boards. On an empty board, there are
                            362,880 possible board states, which is a crazy amount of data to process for a game as
                            simple as Tic Tac Toe.</p>
                        <div class='blogPickWrapper'>
                            <img class='blog-pic' src='./resources/images/buildStatesCodeSnip.png'
                                alt='Code snippet for board state function' />
                        </div>
                        </br>
                        <p class='contentText'>This code snippet builds each possible board state for a single turn. It
                            creates an object for each state, with the keys of board, playerX, playerO, and score. The
                            board is an array of open moves on the board (spaces indexed 0-8), each player has an array
                            of the moves they have taken, and then an initial score is set to 0. After the board is
                            built, it is passed to a scoring function (detScore). The scoring function at this point of
                            my journey set a positive 10 to the score if the maximizing player won on that board, a
                            negative 10 if the minimizing player won on that board, and a 0 if there were no wins on the
                            current board. The minimax function itself would then call buildStates on each sequential
                            open move on the tree, and keep pushing the best scores up.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class='contentText'>I don't have a code snippet for the minimax function at this state,
                            because it went through so many iterations, and pretty much all of them were broken in one
                            way or another. The board states would build correctly, but the scoring algorithm was where
                            I was running into trouble. I kept running into corner cases where the game would not play
                            ideally, but all these cases arose when the human player was not playing ideally. Thanks to
                            an awesome conversation about the miniMax algorithm with one of my teachers, I ended up
                            trying
                            looking just one move ahead, and scoring each move based on the amount of paths to victory
                            for each player would be left with on that board. I set points based on a few conditions. If
                            the
                            maximizing player could win, it would add a score of positive 20 to ensure it picked that
                            spot, then positive 3 if it was setting up win in one move, and positive 1 if it was
                            setting up a win in two more moves. Then the score function minimized each move based on the
                            opponents paths to victory in a similar fashion. The scoring code looked like this:
                        </p>
                        <div class='blogPickWrapper'>
                            <img class='blog-pic' src='./resources/images/detScoreCodeSnip.png'
                                alt='Code snippet for board state function' />
                        </div>
                        <p class='contentText'>Basically, what this is doing is determing how many possible wins each
                            player has on the board, and assigning the score based on that. Then a makeMove function
                            looks at all of those scores, and determines the best move:</p>
                        <div class='blogPickWrapper'>
                            <img class='blog-pic' src='./resources/images/makeMoveCodeSnip.png'
                                alt='Code snippet for board state function' />
                        </div>
                        <p class='contentText'>If you'll notice, there is a small caveat to this approach. If the human
                            player does not play ideally in one corner case, the algorithm doesn't know how to handle
                            it. This only occurs on a board state like this:</p>
                        <div class='blogPickWrapper'>
                            <img class='blog-pic' style='border: 2px dashed black; padding: 4px'

                                alt='Code snippet for board state function' />
                        </div>
                        <p class='contentText'>This problem could be solved by going a couple turns deeper and looking
                            at the
                            depth of the moves, or by simply making a determined move if the board hits that state. I'll
                            be honest, it was getting late and I was staring at anything and everything minimax for so
                            long that I went with the latter. Either way, this was a great learning experience, and a
                            fun challenge to solve. There are many ways to approach this game from a coding standpoint,
                            and I very much enjoyed exploring many of them. I will say, next time I have a
                            problem like this, I'll (try to at least) follow the advice that I always tend to give, and
                            start small. Coding is easier when you build up, not down.</p>

                            that might have been a slight exaggeration... I spent the entire week working on it,
                            basically whenever I could. During the part time course, we got assigned this project called
                            Zorkington, where we had to make a small text based adventure (like Zork) based in
                            Burlington. I asked if I could go off on my own route, and make a game of my own design.
                            Thankfully, that was totally within fine with my professor (Bob... he's the man), and I
                            began excitedly plugging away at what would soon become a small obsession. After some light
                            storyboarding, map drawing, and writing... Robot Apocalypse was born. The game I turned in
                            for that project was ok, but nowhere near what I had envisioned. After the part time class
                            ended, I spent quite a bit of time tinkering with the game, and using it as an excuse to
                            learn new things.</p>
                        </br>
                        <p class='contentText'>Fast forward to about a week and a half ago when I find out that I can
                            continue working on that project, and turn it in for the same project in the Full Time boot
                            camp I'm currently enrolled in. I'm beyond excited to keep working on the game, and dive
                            even deeper into javascript libraries I hadn't worked with before. I find new bugs, learn
                            more about node.js in order to figure them out, find new bugs again, learn more again... the
                            cycle has been incredible. I never thought running full boar into a wall I knew was coming
                            could be so much fun, but that's what coding is all about. Every couple steps forward, there
                            is a step back (sometimes more). I've learned to instead of letting that get me down, to
                            embrace it. It's part of the learning experience, and it's a part that will never go away.

                        <p class='contentText'>I think I'll end this one here, since it feels like I've hit a life
                            lesson of sorts. I've had a hard time in the past with self worth, and feeling like a
                            failure. Coding has really helped me understand that shortcomings and pitfalls are just part
                            of the journey.</p>

                        <p class='contentText'>Hello world! I know it's a bit cliche' to say that, but it's where we all
                            started in our programming journey right? Anyway, since this is the first post in this blog,
                            I figured some introductions would be in order. Since this is all rhetorical, I'll start
                            with myself.... Hi! My name is Josh, and I'm an aspiring web-devoloper. I've been in the
                            restaurant gig for pretty much the entirety of my adult life, and am finally pursuing my
                            passions in the tech world. I'm the father of two amazing children, and am married to an
                            incredible woman that continues to push me towards bettering myself and the world around me.
                            I decided to start writing this blog as a way to sort of catalogue my journey in the world
                            of programming and web development.</p>
                        </br>
                        <p class='contentText'>I am currently in my first week of class in a web development bootcamp at
                            Burlington Code Academy, have taken the part time javascript course here at BCC, and have
                            taken some online courses. As a father with two small children, taking a 40 hour a week
                            course while still working a couple nights a week is already proving to be a challenge, but
                            one that I welcome and am ready to overcome. Being a restaurant manager for many years has
                            gotten me ready for any grind, and the payout this time around is more than worth it.
                            Anyway, I'll keep this post brief, but as I progress through the course, I plan on posting
                            each week with how things are progressing. There will probably be the oddball comic or
                            pictures of the kiddos (like any parent, I'll claim that my kids are adorable...but trust me
                            they are), and most likely snippets of code and projects as time passes. So if you are into
                            coding, cute kids, goofy robot comics, want to see what projects I'm working on, or feel
                            like learning more about me, feel free to stop by each week and check it out!</p>
                        </br>
                        <p class='contentText'>Thanks for checking out my work! Until next week, happy coding!</p>
