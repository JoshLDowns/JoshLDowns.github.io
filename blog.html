                        <p class='contentText'>Hello world! I know it's a bit cliche' to say that, but it's where we all
                            started in our programming journey right? Anyway, since this is the first post in this blog,
                            I figured some introductions would be in order. Since this is all rhetorical, I'll start
                            with myself.... Hi! My name is Josh, and I'm an aspiring web-devoloper. I've been in the
                            restaurant gig for pretty much the entirety of my adult life, and am finally pursuing my
                            passions in the tech world. I'm the father of two amazing children, and am married to an
                            incredible woman that continues to push me towards bettering myself and the world around me.
                            I decided to start writing this blog as a way to sort of catalogue my journey in the world
                            of programming and web development.</p>
                        <p class='contentText'>I am currently in my first week of class in a web development bootcamp at
                            Burlington Code Academy, have taken the part time javascript course here at BCC, and have
                            taken some online courses. As a father with two small children, taking a 40 hour a week
                            course while still working a couple nights a week is already proving to be a challenge, but
                            one that I welcome and am ready to overcome. Being a restaurant manager for many years has
                            gotten me ready for any grind, and the payout this time around is more than worth it.
                            Anyway, I'll keep this post brief, but as I progress through the course, I plan on posting
                            each week with how things are progressing. There will probably be the oddball comic or
                            pictures of the kiddos (like any parent, I'll claim that my kids are adorable...but trust me
                            they are), and most likely snippets of code and projects as time passes. So if you are into
                            coding, cute kids, goofy robot comics, or feel like learning more about me, feel free to
                            stop by each week and check it out!</p>
                        <p class='contentText'>Thanks for stopping by! Until next week, happy coding!</p>
