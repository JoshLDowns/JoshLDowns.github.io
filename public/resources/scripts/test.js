I know it's a bit cliche' to say that, but it's where we all started in our programming journey right? Anyway, since this is the first post in this blog, I figured some introductions would be in order. Since this is all rhetorical, I'll start with myself.... Hi! My name is Josh, and I'm an aspiring web-devoloper. I've been in the restaurant gig for pretty much the entirety of my adult life, and am finally pursuing my passions in the tech world. I'm the father of two amazing children, and am married to an incredible woman that continues to push me towards bettering myself and the world around me. I decided to start writing this blog as a way to sort of catalogue my journey in the world of programming and web development.</p><br><p class='contentText'>I am currently in my first week of class in a web development bootcamp at Burlington Code Academy, have taken the part time javascript course here at BCC, and have taken some online courses. As a father with two small children, taking a 40 hour a week course while still working a couple nights a week is already proving to be a challenge, but one that I welcome and am ready to overcome. Being a restaurant manager for many years has gotten me ready for any grind, and the payout this time around is more than worth it. Anyway, I'll keep this post brief, but as I progress through the course, I plan on posting each week with how things are progressing. There will probably be the oddball comic or pictures of the kiddos (like any parent, I'll claim that my kids are adorable...but trust me they are), and most likely snippets of code and projects as time passes. So if you are into coding, cute kids, goofy robot comics, want to see what projects I'm working on, or feel like learning more about me, feel free to stop by each week and check it out!</p><br><p class='contentText'>Thanks for checking out my work! Until next week, happy coding!</p></div></div>"
